This code is useful for people who might want to place their file system information into a database.

Making this code work requires some Django web framework skills.

## Instructions

- Understand the arguements to ```get_file_system``` by running the following.

```powershell
ps> python3.8 manage.py get_file_system --h
usage: manage.py get_file_system [-h] [--volume VOLUME] [--search_zip_files] [--pictures] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}]
                                 [--settings SETTINGS] [--pythonpath PYTHONPATH] [--traceback] [--no-color]
                                 [--force-color] [--skip-checks]
                                 [base_path [base_path ...]]

Then to run this on my Windows 10 machine and just get my pictures from my ```Pictures``` directory:

```
